SimpleContract DApp
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to register, retrieve, and delete user data stored on the Ethereum blockchain. It consists of a smart contract named SimpleContract deployed using Hardhat and ethers.js.

Features
Register Users: Store user information (name, email, and password) on the blockchain.
Retrieve Users: View all registered users.
Delete Users: Remove user information based on their email.
Smart Contract Details
The smart contract is written in Solidity and allows users to perform the following operations:

setUser: Register a user by providing a name, email, and password.
getAllUsers: Retrieve an array of all registered users.
deleteUser: Delete a user’s information using their email.
Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js
Hardhat: Install by running:
bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev hardhat
Ethers.js: Included as part of Hardhat.
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Compile the Contract
To compile the smart contract, run:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat compile
4. Deploy the Contract
The deployment script is located in the scripts folder. To deploy the contract on a local blockchain network:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
5. Interact with the Contract
Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using Web3.js or ethers.js in a front-end React app. Refer to the App.js for examples of how to call the setUser, getAllUsers, and deleteUser functions.

Frontend DApp
The front-end is built with React.js and allows users to:

Register by entering their name, email, and password.
View all registered users.
Delete a user based on their email.
Running the Frontend
Navigate to the project root and run the following command to start the React app:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Ensure your local blockchain is running using npx hardhat node.

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the DApp.
